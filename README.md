# People Bingo

A simple online [People Bingo](https://www.howdoyouplay.net/icebreakers/how-to-play-people-bingo.html) game.

### See it live

This is published via Github Pages [here](https://ioanastumb.github.io/people-bingo/).

### Run it

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so after doing the usual NodeJs apps dance (install NodeJs and npm, install the project Node modules, cry in frustration because something doesn't work) all you should have to do is run `npm start` and it'll be available on [http://localhost:3000/people-bingo](http://localhost:3000/people-bingo) in the browser.


### Current functionality list 

* Reads input questions and game definitions from the `questions.json` and `games.json` files
* Creates a game session starting from a game definition - can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/people-bingo/games/[gameId]](http://localhost:3000/people-bingo/games/[gameId])
* Lets you have fun with your friends

### Future functionalities

* Will let you create and share your own game sessions (coming soon :tm:)


Happy playing!
